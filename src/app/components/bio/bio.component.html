    My name is Sijun Kim, and I am from South Korea. I am a resilient developer
    who appreciates challenges and thrives on them. I do not fear failing or
    making mistakes when I face challenges. Instead, I take them as
    opportunities to exceed my limit by learning new tools, techniques, and
    approaches. I will continue to find challenges, educate myself on new
    skills, and always be ready to integrate new technologies into practice.

    I graduated high school in Kentucky, and I am currently pursuing a computer
    science degree at Eastern Kentucky University. Throughout college, I have
    built a strong foundation in computer science concepts such as data
    structure, database design, algorithms, computer architecture, networking,
    software testing, and cybersecurity.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.3">
    Not only have I gained a lot of knowledge in Computer Science, but I also
    had the privilege to work as a tutor, mentor, teaching assistant, and junior
    developer as I pursue my undergraduate degree. I built excellent
    communications skill from these jobs, and they allowed me to retain and
    apply the knowledge that I learned in class, which greatly enhanced my
    understanding of computer science.

  <h3 class="center">Next Goals</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.3">
    After graduation, I would like to work for an organization where I could
    contribute my knowledge and skills, and at the same time, grow and learn. I
    want to be exposed to as many different areas as possible in a development
    process both in frontend and backend. I am also planning on pursuing a
    masterâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity simultaneously. I want to be able to not
    only develop programs but also protect the data and information from attacks
    in cyber settings.

    On a side note, I love weightlifting, playing tennis, grilling, and
    traveling. The countries/states I have traveled includes Korea, China,
    Canada, the Philippines, Rhode Island, New York, Kentucky, Illinois, Utah,
    Arizona, Georgia, Tennessee, Idaho, Ohio, and Hawaii. I am planning on
    traveling North Carolina next.
