    My name is Sijun Kim, and I am from South Korea. I graduated high school in
    Richmond Kentucky, and I am currently pursuing a computer science degree at
    Eastern Kentucky University. Throughout college, I built strong fundamental
    computer science concepts such as data structure, database design,
    algorithms, computer architecture, networking, software testing, mobile
    development, and cybersecurity. I am a resilient developer who appreciates
    challenges and thrives on them. I do not fear failing or making mistakes
    when I face challenges. Instead, I take them as opportunities to exceed my
    limit by learning new tools, techniques, and approaches. I will continue to
    find challenges, educate myself on new skills, and always be ready to
    integrate new technologies into practice.

    After graduation, I would like to find a place where I could contribute my
    knowledge and skills, and at the same time, grow and learn. I want to be
    exposed to both backend and frontend development, mobile and web
    development, software and hardware. I look forward to getting opportunities
    to learn more even after college.

    I learned Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and Mips (Assembly Language) from
    school, and I self-educated C#, Python, Typescript, and Angular. The
    software I am familiar with includes Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, SQL
    Server Management Studio, and Github.
